                    It had been a tiring night without actions for Trevor after
                    his father died three days ago. This calm did not last long,
                    until he received a message from the Black Hats mafia
                    threatening him to pay his father's debts.

                    was unable to know which end of the string he would hold to
                    reach his daughter.
